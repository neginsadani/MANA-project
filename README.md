# MANA-Project
First project of MANA Team
This blog is solely a class project introducing the home page with access to personal pages of each group member.

## Introduction
We were a class team of 4 members named Maryam, Ali, Negin, and Abbas. Therefore, we named our group "MANA," which means " the power of elemental forces of nature embodied in an object or person". Unfortunately, Maryam left the group for personal reasons, but we didn't change the group name ðŸ˜».
